/**
 * Script loading is difficult thanks to IE. We need callbacks to fire
 * immediately following the script's execution, with no other scripts
 * running in between. If other scripts on the page are able to run
 * between our script and its callback, bad things can happen, such as
 * `jQuery.noConflict` not being called in time, resulting in plugins
 * latching onto our version of jQuery, etc.
 *
 * For IE<10 we use a relatively well-documented "preloading" strategy,
 * which ensures that the script is ready to execute *before* appending
 * it to the DOM. That way when it is finally appended, it is
 * executed immediately.
