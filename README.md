Little Loader
=============

A lightweight, IE8+ JavaScript loader that is **actually tested**...

[![Travis Status][trav_img]][trav_site]
[![Coverage Status][cov_img]][cov_site]

[![Sauce Test Status][sauce_img]][sauce_site]

... with a very narrow set of objectives:

* **Tested** all the way down to IE8
* Reliably **calls back** after script loads
* Really, really **small** (clocking in at `~666` minified bytes)
* ... and **that's it**!

### Usage

Alone, little loader attaches to `window._lload` for loading your Javascript:

```html
<script>
  window._lload("http://example.com/foo.js", function () {
    // foo.js is loaded!
  }/*, [optional context variable here] */);
</script>
```

If you use an AMD bundling tool (like RequireJS):

```js
define(["little-loader"], function (load) {
  load("http://example.com/foo.js", function () {
    // foo.js is loaded!
  }/*, [optional context variable here] */);
});
```

If you use a CommonJS bundling tool (like Webpack):

```js
var load = require("little-loader");

load("http://example.com/foo.js", function () {
  // foo.js is loaded!
}/*, [optional context variable here] */);
```

### Installation

#### CDN

For the ready-to-use version from CDN, use

```html
<!-- Minified, production version -->
<script src="https://npmcdn.com/little-loader@VERSION/dist/little-loader.min.js"></script>
<!-- Development version -->
<script src="https://npmcdn.com/little-loader@VERSION/lib/little-loader.js"></script>
```

#### NPM

To include `little-loader` as part of your own build, first install from `npm`:

```
$ npm install --save little-loader
```

The library has a UMD wrapper and should work like any other AMD or CommonJS
module with your favorite bundling tool (Webpack, RequireJS, etc.).

If you do not use a CommonJS or AMD loader tool, then little loader will be
exposed as the `window._lload` variable.

### Development

Development requires two installation steps:

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run install-dev
```

After that, run the full lint + tests:

```sh
$ npm run check
```

You can try out the live functional tests fixtures with our static server:

```sh
$ npm run server
```

and navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:3001/test/func/fixtures/

### Releases

**IMPORTANT - NPM**: To correctly run `preversion` your first step is to make
sure that you have a very modern `npm` binary:

```sh
$ npm install -g npm
```

First, you can optionally edit and commit the project history.

```sh
$ vim HISTORY.md
$ git add HISTORY.md
$ git commit -m "Update history for VERSION"
```

Now we're ready to publish. Choose a semantic update for the new version.
If you're unsure, read about semantic versioning at http://semver.org/

```sh
$ npm version VERSION|major|minor|patch -m "Version %s - INSERT_REASONS"
```

Now `postversion` will push to git and publish to NPM.
